''' Retrieve real-time balance data

    The `/accounts/balance/get` endpoint returns the real-time balance for each of 
    an Item's accounts. While other endpoints may return a balance object, only 
    `/accounts/balance/get` forces the available and current balance fields to be 
    refreshed rather than cached. This endpoint can be used for existing Items that 
    were added via any of Plaidâ€™s other products. This endpoint can be used as long 
    as Link has been initialized with any other product, balance itself is not a product 
    that can be used to initialize Link.
